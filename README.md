# 🛠️ Jira Agile Project – Practice Simulation

This project is a **self-directed simulation** of real-world agile project management using **Jira Software Cloud**. It highlights my understanding and hands-on experience with **Kanban workflows**, issue tracking, custom filters, backlog management, and visual reporting tools in Jira.
